We are \"The Angels of Venice,\" a trio of professional female musicians performing original music for harp, flute and cello in the romantic/neoclassical style. Dressed completely in white, we have been told our appearance is as striking as the beauty and feeling our music imparts to our listeners.  We specialize in creating an enchanting atmosphere for special occasions, from small private parties to weddings to large media and world events, of which we have extensive experience.  We have had the collective experience of playing in symphonies and doing session work for movie studios, to performing at the World Cup-sponsored \"Three Tenors\" concert at Dodger Stadium. We were just recently invited to play at The Screen Actors Guild Awards Ceremony Dinner. Our cellist participated in Yanni's \"World Tour 1995\" performing in countries around the world. Members of our prior audiences include Tom Hanks, Bob Hope, Phyllis Diller, Ann-Margaret, Jackson Browne, Graham Nash, Guns 'N Roses, and many others.  Our music evokes happiness and pure joy as well as introspection, self-reflection and contemplation of one's inner spiritual world. Our credo is:   \"The Angels of Venice are Dedicated to Expressing Through Music the Beauty and Mystery of the Human Spirit and Celebrating the Gift of Life.\"     Our current release is entitled \"The Angels of Venice - Music for Harp, Flute and Cello\" and we have manufactured CDs and cassettes of this title. To date we have sold on our own over 5,000 recordings of this original music. We sell directly to customers and through mail order and our music has been circulated from Los Angeles to Russia. We currently have distribution agreements with several well-respected companies.  We are writing to announce our availability to you for performances. We can be contacted at the telephone number listed at the top of this page. The Angels of Venice thank you in advance for your consideration.  Sincerely,  The Angels of Venice  Carol Tatum, Harp     POST OFFICE BOX 50694 PASADENA, CALIFORNIA 91115-0694 CONTACT: (818)548-2422 TO ORDER: 800-7-ANGEL-8    About The Musicians...  Originally from Dallas, Texas, harpist Carol Tatum has been playing stringed instruments since the age of seven and is the founder of \"The Angels of Venice.\" In addition to harp, Carol plays acoustic and electric guitar, mandolin, bouzouki and oud. She is an ASCAP member and published writer including co-writing nine songs for the rock group Kingdom Come's third album on PolyGram and fourth album on Warner Bros. Records. Having been introduced to Strauss waltzes, Vivaldi and Erik Satie at an early age, she combined her classical sensibilities and rock instincts together to weave a unique tapestry of instrumental music that is the style and essence of \"The Angels of Venice.\" She is currently studying with Debussy Trio harpist Marcia Dickstein and makes her home in Glendale, California.  Cellist Sarah O'Brien , originally from Nottingham, England, was invited to the United States on a Fulbright Scholarship to study cello performance at the University of Southern California. Now living in Los Angeles, Sarah is active as a session musician for the major Hollywood studios. Her soundtrack work includes \"Beverly Hills Cop III,\" \"Naked Gun 33 1/3\" and \"Star Trek VII\" and television shows \"Star Trek: Generation,\" \"Deep Space Nine\" and \"Voyager.\" In addition to continued classical concert work, Sarah regularly plays and records with rock musicians and groups of diverse style. She is currently accompanying Yanni on his \"1995 World Tour.\"  Flautist Suzanne Teng was born in Berkley, California and has been playing flute for twenty-three years. She holds a Masters Degree from the School for the Arts at Boston University and is pursuing a Ph.D. from UCLA's Department of Ethnomusicology. Suzanne is a classically trained musician and has performed with classical symphonies, pop orchestras, Baroque chamber ensembles, rock and reggae bands, folk and new age bands and various ethnic music ensembles. She has further performed with Tito Puente, Babatundi Olatunji, Airto and Flora Purim and members of the bands Yes, Little Feat, Spirit and Devo. In addition to flute, Suzanne also sings, plays violin, piano and a variety of percussion instruments and is a professional dancer. Television and commercial credits include \"Murder She Wrote,\" \"Pepsi\" and the feature film \"Separate Lives\" with Jim Belushi and Linda Hamilton. As a teacher, she has instructed hundreds of students at conservatories, music camps and in her private studio and has taught workshops on music and healing.

We are \"The Angels of Venice,\" a trio of professional female musicians performing original music for harp, flute and cello in the romantic/neoclassical style. Dressed completely in white, we have been told our appearance is as striking as the beauty and feeling our music imparts to our listeners.  We specialize in creating an enchanting atmosphere for special occasions, from small private parties to weddings to large media and world events, of which we have extensive experience.  We have had the collective experience of playing in symphonies and doing session work for movie studios, to performing at the World Cup-sponsored \"Three Tenors\" concert at Dodger Stadium. We were just recently invited to play at The Screen Actors Guild Awards Ceremony Dinner. Our cellist participated in Yanni\\'s \"World Tour 1995\" performing in countries around the world. Members of our prior audiences include Tom Hanks, Bob Hope, Phyllis Diller, Ann-Margaret, Jackson Browne, Graham Nash, Guns \\'N Roses, and many others.  Our music evokes happiness and pure joy as well as introspection, self-reflection and contemplation of one\\'s inner spiritual world. Our credo is:   \"The Angels of Venice are Dedicated to Expressing Through Music the Beauty and Mystery of the Human Spirit and Celebrating the Gift of Life.\"     Our current release is entitled \"The Angels of Venice - Music for Harp, Flute and Cello\" and we have manufactured CDs and cassettes of this title. To date we have sold on our own over 5,000 recordings of this original music. We sell directly to customers and through mail order and our music has been circulated from Los Angeles to Russia. We currently have distribution agreements with several well-respected companies.  We are writing to announce our availability to you for performances. We can be contacted at the telephone number listed at the top of this page. The Angels of Venice thank you in advance for your consideration.
